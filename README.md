# Persephone-VR-Headset

This is my open source VR headset. I'm going to make thourough documentation of this project once I have everything fully tested. Right now I am using the Hades VR drivers on an Arduino Pro Micro for testing but am looking for devs to create drivers for the Pi Pico. If you are interested in joinging the project message me @silicate_mineral on Discord.
